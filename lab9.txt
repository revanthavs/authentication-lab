Question 1: What authentication scheme is used by default in Django Rest Framework's browsable API? How is this managed?
Django Rest Framework's browsable API uses session authentication by default, which is managed through the Django authentication middleware.
Question 2: What authentication scheme is used by httpie when querying with the -a or --auth option flag?
When querying with the -a or --auth option flag in httpie, the authentication scheme used by default is Basic Authentication.
Question 3: What is the difference between Session Authentication and Token Authentication? How is Token Authentication an improvement over Basic Authentication?
Session Authentication uses cookies to store session data on the client side, while Token Authentication requires the client to send a token with each request. Token Authentication is stateless and doesn't rely on cookies, providing more flexibility and security compared to Basic Authentication.
Question 4: Provide a high level summary of what happens during an OAuth2 authentication flow. For instance: bitbucket.org > Log In > Log in with Google. What happens when I click "Log in with Google"?
It redirects the user to Google's authentication server to authorize the app's access to their data, then returns a token to the app, which can be used to make API requests on the user's behalf.
